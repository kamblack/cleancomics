Acceptance decisions can be appealed if the content on the site has been updated to follow the standards since the decision was made. 

## "Privacy Policy"

The only information we collect is what goes into the sign-up form: a site name, the URL, and the link to its RSS feed. This information is stored in a Github repository, which is the main engine for maintaining the listing. We collect this information in order to display it again on this site, and so that the ring's functionality can work as intended. Frankly, if you want your website kept private, you shouldn't be putting in in a webring.

We don't collect or store any other info at all. If you would like your listing removed from the ring, feel free to contact an admin and we will be happy to help.

## Right of Removal

The admins reserve the right to remove any site from the list at any time, for any reason. We also reserve the right to take down this service at any time, for any reason. We don't anticipate exercising these rights, but we cannot see the future and we need to provide ourselves options in worst case scenarios.
